# Summary

Near-surface heterogeneities affect seismic waves causing the wavefield to be scattered, this is evidenced in the seismic records and adds complexity in the signals because the reflections of the body waves are masked with a noise that can become up to 10 times greater than common seismic noise [@Stork:2015], making the task of attenuating it difficult. The modeling of surface waves in the presence of heterogeneities is essential to study the propagation of seismic waves in geophysics and engineering. Using the improved vacuum formulation for 2D finite-difference [@Zeng:2012] who incorporates surface topography to the wave propagation simulation (satisfying the free surface condition) it is possible to observe the scattered wavefield for different earth models with shallow random scattering bodies and irregular topography. In addition, this formulation manages to reduce the computational cost of numerical modeling since it requires fewer grid points per wavelength PPW than other methods and is easy to implement to the conventional vacuum formulation 2D finite-difference. 

The analysis of the results of seismic wave propagation over heterogeneous media helps to understand the scattering mechanisms and, therefore, could lead to the development of new data acquisition and processing techniques to reduce the scattering noise, improve the quality of seismic images and classify scattering. Numerical modeling is presented as an open-source software developed in Python.

# Mathematics

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$

You can also use plain \LaTeX for equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
\hat f(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{i\omega x} dx
\end{equation}
and refer to \autoref{eq:fourier} from text.
